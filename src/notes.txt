Abstraction:
Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing
the functionality to the user.
can not have a constructor in parent abstract class but subclass may use constructor.
We can achieve this in two ways
1)Abstract classes
2) Interface

Interface:
Is very similar to an abstract class.
we can have private methods, static methods,default methods,
abstract method an interface.
we can not have instance fields in an interface. because we don't have instance fields we also can't have constructor in an interface.
When we should use  interface:
when objects are closely related to each other we should go with abstract classes.
and there is a "Is a" relationship between classes then we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction.
If objects are not related to each other then we should implement abstraction with the help of interface.
